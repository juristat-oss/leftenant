# leftenant

Lit. "place holder". I quickly and quietly succeed at any task you give me. Just call me. I can be almost anything<sup>&Dagger;</sup> to anybody, but not everything to everybody. That's ok, call me over and over if you need.

<sup><sub><sup>&Dagger;</sup>synchronous function, callback function, Promise/awaitable function (as a thenable), EventEmitter, Duplex stream; with or without `new`</sub></sup>
